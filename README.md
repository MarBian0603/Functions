The repository contains a MATLAB code for computing the value K with some examples.
Before using this code it is mandatory to download the functions at https://github.com/AndScar/noise_estimation.

In syntheti_data_example.m there are some examples of the application of the code to noisy synthetic series.
In real_data_example.m there are some examples of the application of the code to real series.

Pomeau_dyn.m generates noisy series from Pomeau-Manneville maps.
Logistic_dyn.m generates noisy series from Logistic maps.

test.m performs the computation of the value K. 
The functions compute_pq.m and compute_M.m are used in test.m .

choose_f.m is used to compute the frequency band for synthetic time series.

More details about the code usage can be found within each paper.
